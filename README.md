<h2>Arduino-Carnival-Lights-Game</h2>

This a minigame where the active light moves back and forth across a row of 11 lights in order.  
When it reaches the end it travels back in the opposite direction.
When a button is pressed the light stops and if the light stops in the middle the level increases also increasing the speed.
if the button is pressed one away from the middle the speed and level stays the same
if the button is pressed and it lands on a light which isn't the middle or next to the middle the level and speed is lowered.

Uses Arduino Nano, button, 13 LEDs, and keyestudio 8x8 light matrix.

The Zip files are libraries for the matrix

<h2>Reaction Time</h2>

The reaction time project test reactio time from the visual cue of a light to pressing a button.  
The time is displayed on an LCD screen along with a message.
